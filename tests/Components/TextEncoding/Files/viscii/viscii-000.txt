1
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:04,949
I know he can get the job,
but can he do the job?

2
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:13,691
Yeah, Harry, but can he do the job?

3
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:16,964
I know he can get the job...

4
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:19,626
...but can he do the job?

5
00:05:21,305 --> 00:05:23,296
I'm not arguing that with you.

6
00:05:25,209 --> 00:05:27,700
I'm not arguing that with you.

7
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,005
I'm not arguing that with you.

8
00:05:33,117 --> 00:05:35,711
I'm not arguing that with you, Harry!

9
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:42,281
Yeah, but can he do the job?

10
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,922
I know he can get the job,
but can he do the job?

11
00:05:48,032 --> 00:05:50,057
I'm not arguing that with you.

12
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:53,434
Harry, I'm not arguing that with you!

13
00:05:54,372 --> 00:05:58,001
Who said that? I didn't say that.

14
00:05:58,476 --> 00:06:01,138
If I said that, I would have been wrong.

15
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,611
I'm not arguing that with you!

16
00:06:08,953 --> 00:06:13,356
Yeah, Harry, I know he can get the job,
but can he do the job?

17
00:06:14,258 --> 00:06:16,385
I am not arguing that with you!

18
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,686
I am not arguing that with you!

19
00:06:23,534 --> 00:06:26,367
I am not arguing that with you!

20
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,873
Who told you that? No!

21
00:06:31,409 --> 00:06:34,242
I told you that! Me!

22
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,742
What? Maybe.

23
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:39,477
Maybe, maybe.

24
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,904
- Good morning, DeDe.
- Hi, Joe.

25
00:07:37,475 --> 00:07:38,942
What's with the shoe?

26
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,443
I'm losing my sole.

27
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:44,541
How are you?

28
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:47,045
Kind of tired.

29
00:07:49,654 --> 00:07:52,748
Here. Each one gets sent five catalogues.

30
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:55,081
No, I can't do it.

31
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,949
Why not?

32
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,688
I only have 12 catalogues left.

33
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:02,757
Okay.

34
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,367
I'll take care of this.

35
00:08:13,077 --> 00:08:14,339
How are you doing Joe?

36
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:18,475
Well, I'm not feeling very good, Mr. Waturi.

37
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,508
What else is new? You never feel good.

38
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:23,815
Well, that's a problem.

39
00:08:24,755 --> 00:08:28,486
- I have a doctor's appointment today.
- Another doctor's appointment?

40
00:08:30,194 --> 00:08:33,357
Listen Joe, What's this DeDe tells me
about the catalogues?

41
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:37,127
- I only got 12.
- How'd you let that happen?

42
00:08:37,268 --> 00:08:38,758
- I told you.
- When?

43
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:42,332
Three weeks ago, then two weeks ago.

44
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:44,436
Did you tell me last week?

45
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,074
No.

46
00:08:47,144 --> 00:08:49,271
- Why not?
- I thought you knew.

47
00:08:49,346 --> 00:08:52,782
Not good enough, Joe.
Not nearly good enough!

48
00:08:53,384 --> 00:08:57,912
- I put you in charge of the entire advertising library.
- This room.

49
00:08:58,155 --> 00:09:00,953
I gave you carte blank in here.

50
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:04,188
You put the orders in the printer, not me.

51
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:08,525
You're not competent to put orders
into the printer. It's a very technical job.

52
00:09:08,699 --> 00:09:11,930
- You were going to explain it to me.
- Better than that.

53
00:09:12,403 --> 00:09:15,702
I was going to make you
assistant manager.

54
00:09:16,006 --> 00:09:21,103
I want to make you assistant manager.
But you're not flexible. You're inflexible.

55
00:09:21,612 --> 00:09:24,706
- I don't feel inflexible.
- You're inflexible! Totally.

56
00:09:26,784 --> 00:09:30,117
And what this about doctor's appointment?
You're always going to the doctor!

57
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,812
- I don't feel good.
- So what?

58
00:09:33,557 --> 00:09:35,149
You think I feel good?

59
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:37,988
Nobody feels good.

60
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:42,823
After childhood, it's a fact of life.
I feel rotten. So what?

61
00:09:43,267 --> 00:09:46,532
I don't let it bother me
or interfere with my job.

62
00:09:46,771 --> 00:09:48,500
What do you want from me?

63
00:09:48,572 --> 00:09:52,906
You're like a child. What's the lamp for?
Isn't there enough light in here for you?

64
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:57,506
Fluorescents affect me.
They make me feel blotchy and...

65
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:00,883
- ... puffy. I thought this light-
- Get rid of it.

66
00:10:03,053 --> 00:10:06,386
This is not your bedroom, Joe.
This is an office.

67
00:10:07,057 --> 00:10:11,721
If you treat this like a job instead
of a welfare hospital, you'll shape up!

68
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:16,422
I want those catalogues.

69
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:20,063
- Then, please, order them.
- Watch yourself.

70
00:10:21,238 --> 00:10:23,138
Think about what I just said.

71
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:26,743
You've got to get yourself
into a flexible frame...

72
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,978
...or else you are no place.

73
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,879
And take that light off the desk.

74
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:39,816
- I will.
- Do it now.

75
00:10:50,301 --> 00:10:51,393
Good.

76
00:11:01,946 --> 00:11:04,972
- Why do you let him talk to you like that?
- Like what?

77
00:11:05,783 --> 00:11:08,377
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't feel good.

78
00:11:08,485 --> 00:11:11,352
- What's the matter with you?
- I don't know.

79
00:11:14,191 --> 00:11:15,852
I don't know.

80
00:11:17,995 --> 00:11:19,155
<i>Mr. Banks?</i>

81
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:32,168
Dr. Ellison will see you now.

82
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,263
How are you feeling, Mr. Banks?

83
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:07,202
The same. I feel puffy and blotchy.
I never have any energy.

84
00:12:07,544 --> 00:12:11,878
I keep getting these little sore throats.
I just don't feel very good.

85
00:12:12,116 --> 00:12:13,981
How long have you felt this way?

86
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:16,884
Well; Pretty much since
I left the fire department.

87
00:12:17,454 --> 00:12:20,116
On and off since then. About eight years.

88
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,790
What did you do in the fire department?

89
00:12:23,894 --> 00:12:26,419
You know, I put out fires.

90
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:27,828
Was it dangerous?

91
00:12:27,898 --> 00:12:31,891
Yeah, there was some pretty rough stuff,
but I came out of it okay.

92
00:12:32,469 --> 00:12:36,963
The hard part was when I started
never feeling good and had to quit.

93
00:12:39,376 --> 00:12:41,867
I've gotten the results of your tests.

94
00:12:43,847 --> 00:12:45,280
I have cancer.

95
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,980
No.

96
00:12:47,117 --> 00:12:49,415
Something is wrong
with my blood or urine?

97
00:12:49,486 --> 00:12:50,817
They're fine.

98
00:12:52,489 --> 00:12:54,252
But there is something.

99
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,223
- Tell me.
- You have a brain cloud.

100
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,591
Brain cloud?

101
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:05,499
A black fog of tissue
running down the center of your brain.

102
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:07,793
It's very rare.

103
00:13:08,272 --> 00:13:11,332
It'll spread at a regular rate.
It's very destructive.

104
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:14,007
And it's incurable?

105
00:13:15,512 --> 00:13:16,672
Yes.

106
00:13:27,257 --> 00:13:28,383
How long?

107
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:31,451
Six months.
You can count on it being about that.

108
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:33,395
It's not painful.

109
00:13:33,764 --> 00:13:37,131
Your brain will simply fail,
followed abruptly by your body.

110
00:13:38,602 --> 00:13:41,867
You can depend on at least
four or five months of perfect health.

111
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:45,602
What are you talking about?
I don't feel good now.

112
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:49,975
That's the ironic part.
Mr. Banks, you're a hypochondriac.

113
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:53,473
Nothing is wrong that has
anything to do with your symptoms.

114
00:13:54,184 --> 00:13:58,245
I think your experiences
in the fire department were traumatic.

115
00:13:58,522 --> 00:14:02,083
You experienced the imminent possibility
of death several times.

116
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,751
- Yeah.
- You survived.

117
00:14:05,796 --> 00:14:10,062
The cumulative anxiety of those brushes
with death left you habitually fearful...

118
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,264
...about your physical person.

119
00:14:13,404 --> 00:14:16,237
I'm not sick except for a terminal disease?

120
00:14:16,306 --> 00:14:18,638
Which has no symptoms. That's right.

121
00:14:18,909 --> 00:14:23,573
It was because of your insistence
on so many tests that we discovered the problem.

122
00:14:32,322 --> 00:14:33,812
What'll I do?

123
00:14:37,094 --> 00:14:40,757
If you have any savings,
you might think about taking a trip.

124
00:14:41,365 --> 00:14:44,459
- A vacation.
- I don't have any savings.

125
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:48,297
A few hundred bucks.
I spent everything I had on doctors!

126
00:14:50,441 --> 00:14:52,773
Perhaps you'll want a second opinion.

127
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:57,169
Brain cloud.

128
00:14:57,681 --> 00:15:01,845
I knew it. I didn't know it, but I knew it.

129
00:15:10,527 --> 00:15:12,119
What am I going to do?

130
00:15:17,534 --> 00:15:19,968
You have some time left, Mr. Banks.

131
00:15:21,205 --> 00:15:22,866
You have some life left.

132
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,642
My advice to you is:

133
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:29,570
Live it well.

134
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:27,512
No.

135
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,586
You were wrong.

136
00:18:34,398 --> 00:18:35,729
He was wrong.

137
00:18:37,834 --> 00:18:39,961
Who said that? I didn't say that.

138
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:45,665
If I said that, I would have been wrong.

139
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:49,507
I would have been wrong, isn't that right?

140
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,854
I'm not arguing that with you.

141
00:19:02,092 --> 00:19:04,356
I'm not arguing that with you.

142
00:19:07,764 --> 00:19:10,358
I'm not arguing that with you!

143
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,761
Let me call you back.
I got something here.

144
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,375
Don't say anything
until we finish our conversation.

145
00:19:27,551 --> 00:19:29,348
You were at lunch three hours.

146
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,420
About that.

147
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:42,398
Where's my friend? Where is my friend?

148
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:47,631
Mr. Waturi.

149
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,296
Mr. Waturi.

150
00:19:55,078 --> 00:19:56,306
Hello?

151
00:20:00,917 --> 00:20:02,976
This is company property.

152
00:20:03,987 --> 00:20:05,818
Don't touch that!

153
00:20:06,323 --> 00:20:09,588
- What are you doing?
- I'm opening or closing the main drain.

154
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:11,555
You shouldn't be touching that.

155
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:14,429
Nothing happened.

156
00:20:15,432 --> 00:20:18,560
Do you know how long I wondered
what would happen if I did that?

157
00:20:19,603 --> 00:20:22,663
- What's wrong with you?
- Brain cloud.

158
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:26,275
Never mind. Listen, Mr. Waturi.

159
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,940
I quit.

160
00:20:33,016 --> 00:20:35,280
- Today?
- That's right.

161
00:20:35,619 --> 00:20:39,851
That's great. Don't come looking
for a reference from me.

162
00:20:39,923 --> 00:20:41,914
Okay, I won't.

163
00:20:42,259 --> 00:20:43,851
<i>Robinson Crusoe.</i>

164
00:20:44,194 --> 00:20:45,627
You blew this job.

165
00:20:45,962 --> 00:20:48,192
<i>Romeo and Juliet.</i>

166
00:20:49,533 --> 00:20:50,795
<i>The Odyssey.</i>

167
00:20:51,034 --> 00:20:53,195
You blew this job.

168
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:55,368
Ukulele.

169
00:20:55,972 --> 00:20:58,805
I worked here four and a half years.

170
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:02,873
The work I did
I probably could have done in six months.

171
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,314
That leaves four years left over.

172
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:07,810
Four years.

173
00:21:08,985 --> 00:21:10,782
<i>If I had them now...</i>

174
00:21:12,122 --> 00:21:13,680
Like gold in my hand.

175
00:21:14,925 --> 00:21:15,892
Here.

176
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,250
For you.

177
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:20,060
Good-bye, DeDe.

178
00:21:20,597 --> 00:21:22,030
You're going?

179
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:23,994
If you're leaving, leave.

180
00:21:24,534 --> 00:21:28,868
You'll get your check. And I promise you,
you'll be easy to replace.

181
00:21:32,275 --> 00:21:34,766
- I should say something.
- What are you muttering?

182
00:21:37,447 --> 00:21:40,143
<i>This life... Life, what a joke.</i>

183
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:42,811
<i>This situation, this room...</i>

184
00:21:42,886 --> 00:21:44,945
You should just go.

185
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,213
You look terrible, Mr. Waturi.

186
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,086
You look like a bag of shit
stuffed in a cheap suit.

187
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,220
But no one could look good
under these zombie lights.

188
00:21:53,296 --> 00:21:57,130
I can feel them sucking the juice
out of my eyeballs.

189
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,031
Suck! Suck!

190
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:02,836
$300 a week.

191
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:07,407
For $300 a week I've lived in this sink.
This used rubber.

192
00:22:07,644 --> 00:22:11,740
- Watch it. There's a woman here!
- Don't you think I know that?

193
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:14,815
Don't you think I'm aware
there's a woman here?

194
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:18,978
I can smell her like a flower.
I can taste her like sugar on my tongue.

195
00:22:19,122 --> 00:22:23,320
I'm 20 feet away, I can hear the fabric
of her dress when she moves.

196
00:22:25,428 --> 00:22:27,988
But I haven't done anything about it.

197
00:22:28,565 --> 00:22:31,056
I go every day not doing, not saying...

198
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:34,533
...not taking the chance for $300 a week.

199
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:39,735
And, Frank, the coffee, it stinks.

200
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:41,507
It tastes like arsenic.

201
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:44,741
If the lights don't give you a headache,
you must be dead!

202
00:22:44,814 --> 00:22:46,281
So, let's arrange the funeral.

203
00:22:46,349 --> 00:22:48,340
You better go. I'm telling you!

204
00:22:48,685 --> 00:22:50,880
- You're telling me nothing.
- I'm telling you!

205
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:55,288
Why, I ask myself, have I put up with you?
I can't imagine.

206
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:58,853
But I know. It's fear.
Yellow, freaking fear.

207
00:22:58,929 --> 00:23:02,888
I've been too afraid to live my life,
so I sold it to you...

208
00:23:03,133 --> 00:23:06,125
...for $300 dollars a week!

209
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:10,973
You're lucky I don't kill you!
You're lucky I don't rip your throat out!

210
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,367
But I'm not going to!

211
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:16,144
Maybe you're not so lucky...

212
00:23:16,379 --> 00:23:19,644
...because I'm going to leave you here,
Mr. Wahoo Waturi.

213
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,641
What could be worse than that?

214
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,286
- DeDe.
- Yeah.

215
00:23:32,062 --> 00:23:34,758
- How about dinner tonight?
- Okay.

216
00:23:41,905 --> 00:23:44,567
Wow! What a change.

217
00:23:46,676 --> 00:23:50,510
Who am I? That's the real question.
Who am I? Who are you?

218
00:23:50,847 --> 00:23:53,839
What other questions are there, really?

219
00:23:54,084 --> 00:23:58,919
If you want to understand the universe,
embrace it, the door is you.

220
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,689
- Me?
- You. Me.

221
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:06,085
- You are really intense.
- Am I?

222
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:09,762
Yeah, I guess I am. I was.

223
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,700
- What do you mean?
- I mean, a long time ago.

224
00:24:13,937 --> 00:24:18,101
In the beginning I was full
of piss and vinegar. Nothing got me down.

225
00:24:18,508 --> 00:24:19,907
I wanted to know.

226
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,371
Know what?

227
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,714
Everything!
But then I had some experiences.

228
00:24:25,949 --> 00:24:28,713
I talked to this guy
and he says I got scared.

229
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,280
Of what?

230
00:24:31,554 --> 00:24:33,283
Have you ever been scared?

231
00:24:35,125 --> 00:24:37,116
I guess so. Sure.

232
00:24:38,294 --> 00:24:39,852
What scared you?

233
00:24:40,296 --> 00:24:43,231
Lots of things.
At the moment, you scare me a little.

234
00:24:43,466 --> 00:24:46,060
Me? Why should I scare you?

235
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:47,430
I don't know.

236
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:51,571
There's something going on with you.

237
00:24:52,242 --> 00:24:54,403
This morning you were like a lump.

238
00:24:54,577 --> 00:24:56,408
<i>And now you're...</i>

239
00:24:57,814 --> 00:24:59,179
How do you feel?

240
00:24:59,816 --> 00:25:01,147
I feel great.

241
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:03,909
See? You never feel great.

242
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:06,586
No, I never do!

243
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:10,487
What's funny?

244
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,322
I feel great! That is very funny!

245
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:15,993
Where are you?

246
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:17,832
I'm right here!

247
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,267
I wish I was where you are.

248
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:23,833
No, you don't.

249
00:25:25,675 --> 00:25:28,610
Did I ever tell you
that the first time I saw you...

250
00:25:29,012 --> 00:25:31,344
...I felt I had seen you before?

251
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,017
Wait a minute.

252
00:25:52,969 --> 00:25:54,197
What'd you do?

253
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,205
I bribed them to sing a song to drive us
insane and make our hearts burst.

254
00:27:50,153 --> 00:27:51,984
What happened to you?

255
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:57,086
What happened to you that you're so alive?
I can see it.

256
00:27:57,493 --> 00:27:59,825
There's something wrong with my brain.

257
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:03,998
It's not catching,
but I have just five or six months to live.

258
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:10,269
- What?
- I'm going to die.

259
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,773
And I'm just so appreciative of my life.

260
00:28:23,953 --> 00:28:26,581
- I got to go.
- Please, don't.

261
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:32,121
I got to go home. You may have quit,
but I have the job in the morning.

262
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,362
I really want you to stay.

263
00:28:34,864 --> 00:28:37,196
- You're going to die?
- But so what?

264
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:40,630
Stay tonight.
Tomorrow will take care of itself.

265
00:28:56,552 --> 00:28:58,611
I can't handle it, Joe.

266
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,816
Sorry.

267
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:15,667
I forgot my bag.

268
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:12,721
Joe Banks? Mr. Joe Banks?

269
00:30:15,765 --> 00:30:17,460
Have I come at a bad time?

270
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,463
Yes. No.

271
00:30:20,069 --> 00:30:23,664
- I don't know how to answer that question.
- Can I come in to talk?

272
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,879
You're not dressed.

273
00:30:32,315 --> 00:30:34,806
Doesn't bother me if it doesn't bother you.

274
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:38,645
Not a nice place you have, Joe.

275
00:30:39,589 --> 00:30:41,216
Mind if I call you Joe?

276
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,157
Dingy.

277
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:47,089
Dismal. Shabby. Dinky.

278
00:30:47,597 --> 00:30:48,689
Not much.

279
00:30:49,065 --> 00:30:52,296
It's a sign of tremendous sophistication...

280
00:30:52,368 --> 00:30:54,427
...that you haven't demanded my name...

281
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:56,665
...or asked me what I'm doing here.

282
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,003
My name is Samuel Harvey Graynamore.

283
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:04,075
- Joe Banks.
- Oh, I know.

284
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,513
Trying to see the hero in there.

285
00:31:09,185 --> 00:31:10,117
What?

286
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:13,188
You dragged two kids down
a six-story burning staircase.

287
00:31:13,256 --> 00:31:14,416
That was brave.

288
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:19,959
Then you went back for the third kid.
That was heroic. You're a hero!

289
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,193
That was a long time ago.

290
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:26,866
- Yes, it was.
- How do you know my name?

291
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:30,435
I know all about you.
All I could learn in 24 hours, anyway.

292
00:31:30,606 --> 00:31:31,595
Peanuts?

293
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:35,236
- Quit your job?
- Yeah.

294
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,711
Sounded like a dumb job. No family?

295
00:31:39,148 --> 00:31:41,480
Good for you.
Families are a pain in the neck.

296
00:31:43,553 --> 00:31:46,647
What do you know about superconductors?

297
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,318
- Nothing.
- Me, neither.

298
00:31:49,492 --> 00:31:53,326
I own a company that dominates
the world market for superconductors.

299
00:31:53,729 --> 00:31:54,889
Really?

300
00:31:55,898 --> 00:31:57,229
Sit down.

301
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,961
Dr. Ellison...

302
00:32:00,036 --> 00:32:02,266
...you were at his office yesterday?

303
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:04,504
Yes.

304
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,399
He told me your news.

305
00:32:07,076 --> 00:32:10,876
He thought that you and I
might be able to help each other.

306
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:13,947
Got any whiskey?

307
00:32:14,417 --> 00:32:15,577
Nope.

308
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:18,844
I want to hire you, Joe Banks.

309
00:32:20,756 --> 00:32:24,817
I want to hire you to jump into a volcano.

310
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:31,526
You know...

311
00:32:32,535 --> 00:32:34,264
...I do have some whiskey.

312
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:45,547
There's an island in the South Pacific
called Waponi Woo.

313
00:32:45,781 --> 00:32:49,114
The name means:
"The little island with the big volcano. "

314
00:32:49,452 --> 00:32:54,287
The Waponis are a cheerful people
who live simply fishing and picking fruit.

315
00:32:54,624 --> 00:32:59,118
Their one fear is that big volcano.
They call it the Big Woo.

316
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:00,688
They believe...

317
00:33:00,763 --> 00:33:04,859
...that an angry fire god in the volcano
will sink the island...

318
00:33:05,168 --> 00:33:08,001
...unless once every 100 years
he is appeased.

319
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:11,403
It's been 99 years,
11 months, and 11 days...

320
00:33:11,474 --> 00:33:15,808
...since the fire god got his propers,
and the Waponis are scared.

321
00:33:15,978 --> 00:33:17,912
How is the god appeased?

322
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:22,274
Of his own free will,
a man has to jump into the volcano.

323
00:33:22,752 --> 00:33:27,553
None of the Waponis are anxious
for the honor of jumping into the Big Woo.

324
00:33:28,758 --> 00:33:31,522
- So, what do you do?
- What?

325
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:33,988
You do some trading.

326
00:33:36,265 --> 00:33:40,258
There's a mineral on that island,
Mr. Banks, called bubureau.

327
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:44,130
There isn't anywhere else
you can find more than a gram.

328
00:33:44,207 --> 00:33:45,265
I've looked.

329
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:49,004
Because without bubureau,
I can't make superconductors.

330
00:33:49,078 --> 00:33:51,672
I tried to get mineral rights
from the Waponis but...

331
00:33:51,747 --> 00:33:53,977
...I have nothing they want.

332
00:33:55,518 --> 00:33:58,282
But they do want a hero, Mr. Banks.

333
00:33:59,222 --> 00:34:02,589
They'll give me the mineral rights
if I find them one.

334
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:05,457
Why would I jump into a volcano?

335
00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:09,259
From your actions in the fire department,
I think you have the courage.

336
00:34:09,332 --> 00:34:10,390
You do?

337
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:14,061
Is it more gutsy to twice traverse
a staircase in flames...

338
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:17,299
...or to make a one-time leap
into the mouth of a smoking volcano?

339
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:19,869
<i>Damned if I know, kimosabe.</i>

340
00:34:20,142 --> 00:34:24,977
I know when you make those kinds of calls,
you're up in high country.

341
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:31,480
From your doctor, you're on your way out.

342
00:34:31,721 --> 00:34:33,814
You have no money. I checked.

343
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:37,391
Want to wait it out in this apartment?

344
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:42,154
That sounds grim to me.
Not the way I'd want to go, I'll tell you.

345
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:45,593
These are yours if you take the job.

346
00:34:46,168 --> 00:34:50,195
It's 20 days from today
before you'd have to jump into the volcano.

347
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:55,166
You could shop today.
Get yourself clothes for an adventure.

348
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:59,178
Then tomorrow, a plane to L.A.
First class, naturally.

349
00:34:59,415 --> 00:35:01,508
You'll stay at the best hotel.

350
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:06,586
The next day you board a yacht.
My competitors often watch the airports.

351
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:09,848
My yacht's a beauty. Gourmet chef.

352
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,626
Sail to the South Pacific in 15 days.

353
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:16,755
Waponis come out to meet you.
A total red-carpet situation.

354
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,331
You're a hero, like Charles Lindbergh.

355
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:23,596
Wine, women, and song
in the sweetest paradise you ever saw.

356
00:35:23,873 --> 00:35:24,840
Then...

357
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:28,203
...you jump into the volcano.

358
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:31,608
Live like a king, die like a man, I say.

359
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:33,212
What do you say?

360
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:40,815
I'll do it.

361
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:43,455
Here's my card.

362
00:35:43,526 --> 00:35:46,791
And your plane ticket, American.
Noon out of Kennedy tomorrow.

363
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:52,263
<i>I have an American Express gold card.
Can I rent a limousine for the day?</i>

364
00:35:53,002 --> 00:35:55,232
<i>Great. Does the driver come with that?</i>

365
00:35:55,304 --> 00:35:57,704
<i>Great. Do you rent anything else?</i>

366
00:35:58,374 --> 00:36:00,171
<i>No, okay, that's it.</i>

367
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:15,454
So, where would you like to go?

368
00:36:16,992 --> 00:36:18,152
Excuse me?

369
00:36:18,761 --> 00:36:22,424
- Where would you like to go, sir?
- I'd like to do some shopping.

370
00:36:22,765 --> 00:36:25,097
Where would you like to go shopping?

371
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,599
I don't know.

372
00:36:28,671 --> 00:36:29,763
All right.

373
00:36:30,506 --> 00:36:33,270
- Where would you go shopping?
- What do you need?

374
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:36,842
- Clothes.
- What kind? What's your taste?

375
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:39,778
I don't exactly know.

376
00:36:42,518 --> 00:36:44,349
Why are you stopping?

377
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:49,285
You hired me to drive the car,
not to tell you who you are.

378
00:36:49,525 --> 00:36:51,186
I didn't ask you that.

379
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:56,295
You're hinting around about clothes.
That's an important topic to me, Mr...?

380
00:36:56,966 --> 00:36:59,958
- Banks.
- Clothes make the man. I believe that.

381
00:37:00,302 --> 00:37:03,738
You say you want to buy clothes,
but you don't know what kind.

382
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:06,741
You leave it hanging in the air
like I'll fill in the blanks.

383
00:37:06,809 --> 00:37:09,972
That's like asking me who you are,
and I don't know who you are.

384
00:37:10,045 --> 00:37:11,569
I don't want to know.

385
00:37:11,647 --> 00:37:16,414
It's taken me all my life to find out
who I am, and I am tired now.

386
00:37:16,485 --> 00:37:18,009
Hear what I'm saying?

387
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:21,782
- What's your name?
- Joe.

388
00:37:22,658 --> 00:37:24,819
Mine is Marshall. How do you do?

389
00:37:25,561 --> 00:37:28,496
Wait a minute. I'm coming back.

390
00:37:38,607 --> 00:37:42,008
Now, what's your situation?
Explain it to me.

391
00:37:42,077 --> 00:37:44,170
I'm going on a long trip.

392
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:48,213
And I have the opportunity
to buy some clothes today.

393
00:37:49,285 --> 00:37:52,948
- Money is no object.
- Good. Where are you going?

394
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:56,224
Tonight I'm going out in the city.

395
00:37:56,559 --> 00:37:58,220
- Nice places?
- I hope so.

396
00:37:58,461 --> 00:38:01,055
- Tomorrow I fly to L.A.
- First class?

397
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:02,186
Yeah.

398
00:38:02,465 --> 00:38:04,729
Then I'm sailing to the South Pacific.

399
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,963
- Hawaii?
- No, an unknown little island.

400
00:38:08,304 --> 00:38:09,965
- No tourists?
- I don't think so.

401
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:10,698
Good.

402
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,437
I'll stay on the island for a few weeks,
and that's it.

403
00:38:14,844 --> 00:38:17,142
What kind of clothes do you have now?

404
00:38:17,246 --> 00:38:19,214
The kind of clothes I'm wearing.

405
00:38:19,281 --> 00:38:20,873
So, you got no clothes.

406
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:41,968
- Hey, Joe, how about a tux?
- I'll get one, if you get one?

407
00:38:42,505 --> 00:38:45,941
I can't be buying no Armani tux.
I'm a workingman.

408
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:49,409
No one is paying you
to give me all this advice.

409
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:52,106
Let me buy you the tux
and we'll call it even.

410
00:38:54,517 --> 00:38:58,180
- I feel like I'm getting married.
- I feel like I'm giving you away.

411
00:39:11,467 --> 00:39:14,300
All right. I'll take nine pairs.

412
00:39:33,155 --> 00:39:35,988
Give me Cassie Cimorelli, please.

413
00:39:37,593 --> 00:39:40,756
<i>Hello, Cassie. It's Marshall. How do?</i>

414
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,825
<i>Good.
I got somebody that needs you today.</i>

415
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:48,730
You look like a prince in a fairy tale.

416
00:39:49,271 --> 00:39:51,068
You're coming into focus, kid.

417
00:40:08,591 --> 00:40:09,922
I'll take it.

418
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,194
Swiss army knife, world-band travel radio,
shaving kit...

419
00:40:15,431 --> 00:40:18,923
...two Coleman lanterns,
and a violin case bar.

420
00:40:19,201 --> 00:40:21,032
Will there be anything else?

421
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:23,766
I'll take this.

422
00:40:28,444 --> 00:40:31,208
<i>Have you thought much about luggage?</i>

423
00:40:31,447 --> 00:40:33,108
<i>No, I never really have.</i>

424
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:36,374
It's the central preoccupation of my life.

425
00:40:37,219 --> 00:40:40,552
You travel the world,
you're away from home...

426
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:42,723
...perhaps away from your family...

427
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:47,228
...all you have to depend on is yourself,
and your luggage.

428
00:40:47,463 --> 00:40:49,124
I guess that's true.

429
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:53,126
- Are you traveling light or heavy?
- Heavy.

430
00:40:53,469 --> 00:40:56,404
- Flying?
- Flying and by ship.

431
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:58,670
- An ocean voyage.
- Yes.

432
00:41:06,482 --> 00:41:08,575
A real journey.

433
00:41:08,984 --> 00:41:10,713
Then I'll be on an island.

434
00:41:10,919 --> 00:41:14,582
I don't know if I'll be living
in a hut or what.

435
00:41:15,491 --> 00:41:17,254
Very exciting...

436
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:23,795
...as a luggage problem.

437
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,066
I have just the thing.

438
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:01,161
This is our premier steamer trunk.

439
00:42:01,503 --> 00:42:04,495
All handmade, only the finest materials.

440
00:42:04,907 --> 00:42:08,070
It's even watertight. Tight as a drum.

441
00:42:09,344 --> 00:42:12,507
If I had the need and the wherewithal,
Mr. Banks...

442
00:42:13,015 --> 00:42:15,210
...this would be my trunk of choice.

443
00:42:15,884 --> 00:42:17,112
I'll take four.

444
00:42:17,352 --> 00:42:20,515
May you live to be
a thousand years old, sir.

445
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,057
Same to you.

446
00:42:23,425 --> 00:42:26,553
<i>- Where to? Back to Staten Island?
- No.</i>

447
00:42:28,430 --> 00:42:30,261
<i>A really nice hotel.</i>

448
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:32,525
The Plaza.

449
00:42:33,268 --> 00:42:34,758
The Plaza is nice.

450
00:42:35,938 --> 00:42:37,371
Where would you go?

451
00:42:37,706 --> 00:42:40,675
- The Pierre.
- Then we're off to the Pierre.

452
00:42:42,945 --> 00:42:46,278
Marshall, would you like to have dinner
with me tonight?

453
00:42:46,615 --> 00:42:50,073
I can't. I have the wife and kids
at the end of the day.

454
00:42:52,721 --> 00:42:55,189
Everything is at check-in
when you're ready, sir.

455
00:42:57,793 --> 00:42:58,782
Listen.

456
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:04,893
- Haven't you got anybody?
- No, but...

457
00:43:06,235 --> 00:43:10,137
...there are certain times when
you're not supposed to have anyone.

458
00:43:10,405 --> 00:43:12,805
Certain doors you must go through alone.

459
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:16,468
You'll be all right.

460
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:48,192
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we're descending into Los Angeles.</i>

461
00:44:50,239 --> 00:44:52,673
That was totally awesome.

462
00:45:03,352 --> 00:45:07,311
- Hi. Are you Joe Banks?
- Yeah. Who are you?

463
00:45:07,756 --> 00:45:11,715
I'm the daughter of the guy who hired you.
Angelica Graynamore.

464
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:15,128
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

465
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:19,799
Daddy told me to say I don't know
why he hired you, and not to tell me.

466
00:45:19,868 --> 00:45:23,804
I'm totally untrustworthy.
I'm a flibbertigibbet.

467
00:45:24,039 --> 00:45:26,507
Come on, let's get out of here.

468
00:45:26,675 --> 00:45:28,199
I have some luggage.

469
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:30,544
Then, follow me.

470
00:45:35,450 --> 00:45:39,784
- I've never been to L.A. before.
- You're kidding. What do you think?

471
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:43,355
It looks big. I like it.

472
00:45:46,862 --> 00:45:48,523
This is a great town.

473
00:45:48,864 --> 00:45:52,027
It stinks, but it's a great town.

474
00:46:03,612 --> 00:46:05,580
Sea scallops with three caviars.

475
00:46:06,381 --> 00:46:08,372
The Dungeness crabs.

476
00:46:12,454 --> 00:46:15,014
- Pepper?
- No.

477
00:46:20,062 --> 00:46:21,461
What's the matter?

478
00:46:21,797 --> 00:46:22,889
Nothing.

479
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:26,200
They do look like little monsters.

480
00:46:27,135 --> 00:46:29,296
But they're good, little monsters.

481
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:35,800
What did you do
before you signed on with Daddy?

482
00:46:36,979 --> 00:46:40,471
I was an advertising librarian
for a medical supply company.

483
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,218
I have no response to that.

484
00:46:45,487 --> 00:46:46,852
What do you do?

485
00:46:46,922 --> 00:46:48,355
What do I do?

486
00:46:49,758 --> 00:46:50,816
Why?

487
00:46:50,926 --> 00:46:52,894
Well, I don't know.

488
00:46:54,496 --> 00:46:56,487
I'm a painter and a poet.

489
00:46:58,266 --> 00:47:00,234
- Really?
- Yes.

490
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:03,935
There's a painting of mine right there.

491
00:47:07,009 --> 00:47:08,442
That's terrific.

492
00:47:09,177 --> 00:47:10,872
Where do you get your ideas?

493
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:13,608
You have to understand something
about art.

494
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:16,650
It comes from some place.

495
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:47,533
"covered the emptiness of my hands"

496
00:48:15,009 --> 00:48:16,408
What's the matter?

497
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,968
You ever think about killing yourself?.

498
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:22,680
What?

499
00:48:23,618 --> 00:48:25,176
Why would you do that?

500
00:48:25,887 --> 00:48:27,320
Why shouldn't I?

501
00:48:28,723 --> 00:48:31,317
Some things take care of themselves.

502
00:48:31,392 --> 00:48:34,225
They're not your job.
Maybe not even your business.

503
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,900
I like your poem.

504
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:46,496
I'm a grown woman
and I live on my father's money.

505
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:51,911
The restaurant that had my painting up
is my father's restaurant.

506
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:54,506
Listen to me.

507
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:58,512
If you have a choice
between killing yourself, and...

508
00:48:59,087 --> 00:49:01,681
...doing something you're scared of doing...

509
00:49:02,023 --> 00:49:05,186
...why not do the thing
you're scared of doing?

510
00:49:06,527 --> 00:49:10,019
You mean stop taking money
and leave L.A.?

511
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:13,026
See? You know
what you're scared of doing.

512
00:49:13,134 --> 00:49:16,399
Why don't you do it? See what happens?

513
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,931
You must be tired.

514
00:49:21,209 --> 00:49:22,733
I don't mind talking.

515
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:24,576
I do.

516
00:49:24,879 --> 00:49:28,076
This is one of those conversations
where we're open...

517
00:49:28,149 --> 00:49:30,640
...and sharing our thoughts
and it's all bullshit...

518
00:49:30,718 --> 00:49:33,812
...and a lie,
and it doesn't cost you anything!

519
00:49:36,624 --> 00:49:38,956
Look, I don't know you.

520
00:49:39,293 --> 00:49:41,625
I don't think I know anybody.

521
00:49:42,897 --> 00:49:45,559
I can see that you're angry.

522
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,565
I'm very troubled.

523
00:49:53,307 --> 00:49:55,138
<i>I'm not ready to...</i>

524
00:50:00,081 --> 00:50:02,914
There's only so much time, and...

525
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:09,121
...you want to use it well.
So, I'm here, talking to you.

526
00:50:10,324 --> 00:50:12,349
I don't want to throw that away.

527
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,889
I have no response to that.

528
00:50:21,335 --> 00:50:24,498
Maybe you should take me
back to the hotel.

529
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,278
Want me to come up with you?

530
00:50:43,925 --> 00:50:45,290
No.

531
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,587
All right.

532
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:49,019
Will you meet me for breakfast?

533
00:50:49,797 --> 00:50:53,324
You have to be at the boat by 10:00,
but we can meet for breakfast.

534
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,563
Okay.

535
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,702
I told you I was a flibbertigibbet.

536
00:52:03,437 --> 00:52:04,836
What do you think?

537
00:52:06,774 --> 00:52:08,105
It's terrific.

538
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,375
I'm sorry I was so grotesque last night.

539
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:13,111
You were fine.

540
00:52:13,381 --> 00:52:14,905
I disappointed you.

541
00:52:17,285 --> 00:52:19,446
What did Daddy hire you to do?

542
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:22,612
It's complicated.

543
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,721
Okay, don't tell me.

544
00:52:25,192 --> 00:52:26,489
Thank you.

545
00:52:26,894 --> 00:52:29,454
- I bet Patricia knows.
- Who's Patricia?

546
00:52:29,664 --> 00:52:33,122
My half sister.
She's sailing you wherever you're going.

547
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:34,695
She is?

548
00:52:34,835 --> 00:52:36,325
You didn't know?

549
00:52:38,306 --> 00:52:42,072
Daddy loves a secret almost as much
as he loves money.

550
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,475
Can I ask you something?

551
00:52:49,417 --> 00:52:51,612
Why are you dressed like Jungle Jim?

552
00:52:52,653 --> 00:52:54,143
I could change.

553
00:52:54,488 --> 00:52:57,423
Do you think this is inappropriate
for the boat?

554
00:53:00,761 --> 00:53:02,752
No, it's fine.

555
00:53:04,932 --> 00:53:06,456
We better go.

556
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:09,367
I have a guy taking your trunks
to the marina...

557
00:53:09,437 --> 00:53:12,497
...who may or may not have understood
my directions.

558
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,772
Come on.

559
00:53:15,409 --> 00:53:17,172
<i>Ándale, ándale.</i>

560
00:53:20,281 --> 00:53:22,215
- Is that it?
- Yeah.

561
00:53:24,018 --> 00:53:25,952
What's the trunks, Felix?

562
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:27,847
<i>Those are...</i>

563
00:53:28,022 --> 00:53:30,081
My name's not Felix, it's Joe.

564
00:53:30,358 --> 00:53:31,620
I know.

565
00:53:36,197 --> 00:53:38,461
- That's your half sister?
- Yeah.

566
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,293
That outfit is wearing you, Felix.

567
00:53:42,036 --> 00:53:44,300
Why are you calling me Felix?
My name is Joe.

568
00:53:44,372 --> 00:53:47,205
I'm calling you Felix
because I do what I want.

569
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:48,838
Hello, Angelica.

570
00:53:48,909 --> 00:53:51,810
Hello, Patricia.
Do you know where Daddy is?

571
00:53:53,214 --> 00:53:56,843
We never know where our father is
and always suspect the other one knows.

572
00:53:56,917 --> 00:53:59,977
But it's all phone calls and telegrams,
eh, Angelica?

573
00:54:00,554 --> 00:54:03,022
Well, you're in a rotten mood.

574
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,057
The sunshine gets me down.

575
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:08,159
Where are you going?

576
00:54:08,229 --> 00:54:13,064
Dad says not to tell you. Goes with
my theory. Power makes you paranoid.

577
00:54:14,568 --> 00:54:17,503
Well, get ready to heave, Felix.

578
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,497
My name is Joseph or Joe.

579
00:54:22,343 --> 00:54:25,835
All right, Joe. Get ready. We're leaving.

580
00:54:27,181 --> 00:54:29,240
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

581
00:54:31,085 --> 00:54:32,518
You're shaking.

582
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:34,319
I am?

583
00:55:47,361 --> 00:55:48,726
Here you go.

584
00:55:49,797 --> 00:55:51,560
That looks delicious.

585
00:55:51,832 --> 00:55:54,164
<i>We eat well aboard the Tweedle Dee.</i>

586
00:55:54,502 --> 00:55:57,232
<i>- The Tweedle Dee?
- That's the name of the boat.</i>

587
00:55:58,506 --> 00:56:01,998
So, we're going to the island
of Waponi Woo.

588
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,441
- I guess so.
- Why?

589
00:56:04,945 --> 00:56:06,503
- You don't know?
- No.

590
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,813
- Have you been there?
- No.

591
00:56:10,518 --> 00:56:14,511
All I know is the name means
"Little island with the big volcano"...

592
00:56:14,588 --> 00:56:17,921
...and the people, the Waponis,
like orange soda.

593
00:56:18,859 --> 00:56:20,622
They like orange soda?

594
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:25,493
"1,800 years ago a Roman galley
with a crew of Jews and Druids...

595
00:56:25,566 --> 00:56:27,966
"... got caught in a storm off Carthage.

596
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:30,630
"They were swept 1,000 miles off course...

597
00:56:30,704 --> 00:56:33,468
"... and ended up
on the wrong side of Africa.

598
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:37,204
"Trying to return to Rome,
they sailed into the South Pacific...

599
00:56:37,278 --> 00:56:40,873
"... and colonized a lightly populated
Polynesian island...

600
00:56:41,382 --> 00:56:43,475
"... which they named Waponi Woo.

601
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:45,313
"Thus was born the Waponi culture...

602
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:48,822
"... a mix of Polynesian, Celtic, Hebrew,
and Latin influences.

603
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,384
"The Waponi are known to have
a peculiar love of orange soda...

604
00:56:53,661 --> 00:56:55,652
"... and no sense of direction. "

605
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:59,765
Why did you talk so snotty
back on the dock?

606
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:06,499
Because you work for my father,
and I'm angry with my father.

607
00:57:07,474 --> 00:57:09,169
Why are you angry with him?

608
00:57:09,243 --> 00:57:11,006
Because he's never around.

609
00:57:11,178 --> 00:57:13,669
If you're angry, why do you work for him?

610
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:18,011
I don't work for him.
My transport of you is strictly a favor.

611
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:20,411
You do favors for people you're mad at?

612
00:57:20,521 --> 00:57:22,011
I don't work for him.

613
00:57:25,259 --> 00:57:27,659
He's giving me this boat for taking you.

614
00:57:30,531 --> 00:57:32,192
He's got two of them.

615
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:34,864
<i>There's a Tweedle Dum, too.</i>

616
00:57:35,102 --> 00:57:37,434
That makes everything okay, then.

617
00:57:38,105 --> 00:57:39,629
Yes, it does.

618
00:57:48,782 --> 00:57:50,249
Is this okay?

619
00:57:50,584 --> 00:57:51,744
Sure.

620
00:57:52,386 --> 00:57:56,322
The boys sleep in the hull.
Dagmar usually sleeps on deck.

621
00:57:56,657 --> 00:58:00,149
So you have things to yourself.
I'm in the little stateroom.

622
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:02,025
Great.

623
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:08,961
I'm sorry I was rude on the dock.

624
00:58:09,136 --> 00:58:10,467
It's okay.

625
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:15,136
Did you sleep with my sister?

626
00:58:18,345 --> 00:58:19,369
No.

627
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:21,571
Actually, she's my half sister.

628
00:58:23,651 --> 00:58:25,175
No, I didn't.

629
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:29,516
- You like to fish?
- Sure.

630
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,956
Tomorrow we'll do some fishing.

631
00:58:36,397 --> 00:58:37,830
This is the light switch.

632
00:58:37,898 --> 00:58:40,093
Did Mike show you
how to work the bathroom?

633
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:41,498
Yeah.

634
00:58:45,406 --> 00:58:48,239
Do you want me to turn it off while I go?

635
00:58:48,575 --> 00:58:50,008
Okay.

636
00:58:54,848 --> 00:58:57,646
I love my sister,
even though she's screwed up.

637
00:58:59,019 --> 00:59:02,079
I love my father,
even though I never see him...

638
00:59:02,423 --> 00:59:04,823
...and he's not great when I do see him.

639
00:59:05,859 --> 00:59:07,326
I'm nervous about this trip.

640
00:59:07,428 --> 00:59:10,955
Neither you nor my father
will tell me anything.

641
00:59:11,432 --> 00:59:13,263
But it's more than that.

642
00:59:17,237 --> 00:59:20,468
I've always kept clear of my father's stuff
since I was on my own...

643
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:22,532
...and he's pulled me back in.

644
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:25,773
He used this boat
to get me to work for him...

645
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:28,143
...which I swore I'd never do.

646
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:34,384
I feel ashamed...

647
00:59:36,056 --> 00:59:37,956
...because I had a price.

648
00:59:39,226 --> 00:59:42,286
He named it,
and now I know that about myself.

649
00:59:45,065 --> 00:59:48,626
I could treat you like I did on the dock,
but that would be...

650
00:59:49,903 --> 00:59:53,566
...me kicking myself for selling out,
which isn't fair to you.

651
00:59:54,975 --> 00:59:56,966
Doesn't make me feel any better.

652
01:00:00,080 --> 01:00:04,574
I don't know your situation,
but I wanted you to know mine.

653
01:00:04,818 --> 01:00:07,651
Not just to explain some rude behavior...

654
01:00:08,322 --> 01:00:09,653
...but because...

655
01:00:11,325 --> 01:00:13,919
...we're on a little boat for a while and...

656
01:00:14,762 --> 01:00:16,252
...I'm soul sick.

657
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,491
You'll see that.

658
01:00:23,270 --> 01:00:26,967
Like my sister. She's soul sick, too.
If you'd slept with her...

659
01:00:27,841 --> 01:00:30,173
...I'd have known something about you.

660
01:00:32,179 --> 01:00:33,669
But you didn't.

661
01:00:35,682 --> 01:00:37,013
You didn't.

662
01:00:37,618 --> 01:00:39,279
And I believe you.

663
01:00:40,954 --> 01:00:42,649
I'm glad you believe me.

664
01:00:44,525 --> 01:00:46,516
Have you slept on a boat before?

665
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:48,862
No.

666
01:00:48,962 --> 01:00:51,192
It really effects your dreams.

667
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:55,860
I look forward to it, though the dreams
sometimes shake me up.

668
01:00:58,472 --> 01:00:59,700
Okay.

669
01:01:00,641 --> 01:01:01,801
Good night.

670
01:03:04,598 --> 01:03:06,463
<i>I'm leaving you on this island?</i>

671
01:03:06,533 --> 01:03:08,558
- That's right.
- For how long?

672
01:03:09,169 --> 01:03:10,830
For the rest of my life.

673
01:03:11,939 --> 01:03:13,634
I can't imagine that.

674
01:03:13,774 --> 01:03:15,765
- Are you used to this?
- What?

675
01:03:16,843 --> 01:03:19,368
The ocean. The stars.

676
01:03:22,115 --> 01:03:24,015
You never get used to it.

677
01:03:24,685 --> 01:03:28,280
That's why I want this boat.
All I want to do is sail away.

678
01:03:29,456 --> 01:03:31,048
Where would you go?

679
01:03:31,792 --> 01:03:34,352
Away from the things of man.

680
01:03:40,834 --> 01:03:42,392
Do you believe in God?

681
01:03:43,537 --> 01:03:45,471
I believe in myself.

682
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,371
What's that mean?

683
01:03:49,476 --> 01:03:51,706
I have confidence in myself.

684
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:57,883
I've been doing some soul-searching lately.
Know what I found out?

685
01:04:01,154 --> 01:04:03,213
I have no interest in myself.

686
01:04:03,523 --> 01:04:06,583
I start thinking about myself,
I get bored out of my mind.

687
01:04:08,895 --> 01:04:10,522
What does interest you?

688
01:04:11,365 --> 01:04:12,593
I don't know.

689
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:15,461
Courage. Courage interests me.

690
01:04:16,136 --> 01:04:20,266
So, you'll spend the rest of your life
on an island in the South Pacific?

691
01:04:20,741 --> 01:04:24,575
Till now I've lived on a tiny island
called Staten Island.

692
01:04:25,846 --> 01:04:30,408
Commuted to this job in a shut-up room,
pumped-in air, no sunshine...

693
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:32,184
...despicable people.

694
01:04:32,252 --> 01:04:36,518
Now that I have some distance from
the situation, I find that unbelievable.

695
01:04:37,758 --> 01:04:40,955
Your life seems unbelievable to me.

696
01:04:41,028 --> 01:04:43,496
But all of this life seems so...

697
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:46,759
...unbelievable to me.

698
01:04:49,102 --> 01:04:51,696
My father says the whole world is asleep.

699
01:04:51,805 --> 01:04:55,138
Everyone you know, everyone you see,
everyone you talk to.

700
01:04:55,609 --> 01:04:57,873
Only a few people are awake...

701
01:04:57,944 --> 01:05:02,438
...and they live in a state
of constant, total amazement.

702
01:05:10,957 --> 01:05:12,891
I have six months to live.

703
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:16,929
The Waponis believe they need
a human sacrifice or the island will sink.

704
01:05:16,997 --> 01:05:20,558
Your father hired me
to jump into the volcano.

705
01:05:22,669 --> 01:05:23,636
What?

706
01:05:23,703 --> 01:05:26,069
You're not gonna make me say that again,
are you?

707
01:05:26,139 --> 01:05:27,265
No!

708
01:05:29,142 --> 01:05:30,109
Well?

709
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:33,404
Aren't you going to say anything?

710
01:05:36,917 --> 01:05:38,544
I don't know what to say.

711
01:05:38,618 --> 01:05:42,850
You say you're dying, and going
to jump into a volcano. My mind is blank.

712
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:45,151
I can understand that.

713
01:05:46,426 --> 01:05:47,757
Is it catching?

714
01:05:48,261 --> 01:05:49,819
No, no, no.

715
01:05:54,434 --> 01:05:56,994
Good night. I'll see you in the morning.

716
01:06:05,345 --> 01:06:07,006
It's weird today, huh?

717
01:06:07,781 --> 01:06:09,612
There's a typhoon warning.

718
01:06:09,950 --> 01:06:12,680
- Good morning, Mr. Banks.
- Good morning, Dagmar.

719
01:06:13,286 --> 01:06:16,119
Looks like we're in for a blow.

720
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:32,302
Can I help?

721
01:06:32,939 --> 01:06:34,600
Yeah, tie that up.

722
01:06:36,376 --> 01:06:38,139
Feels dead, doesn't it?

723
01:06:39,146 --> 01:06:40,807
Yeah, it does.

724
01:06:41,648 --> 01:06:42,672
Mike?

725
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:47,884
Get below, start the engine.
Tell Tony to head us into the wind.

726
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:51,649
- There isn't any wind.
- There will be.

727
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:54,891
You worried?

728
01:06:55,562 --> 01:07:00,056
We'll be okay. The hatches and sails
are down. We're ahead of the game.

729
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:05,663
What exactly is a typhoon?

730
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:09,674
You know...

731
01:07:10,177 --> 01:07:12,509
...I think you're going to find out.

732
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,829
<i>Mayday! This is the Tweedle Dee.</i>

733
01:07:39,906 --> 01:07:41,771
Latitude: 10 degrees, 8 minutes south.

734
01:07:41,841 --> 01:07:45,402
Longitude: approximately 150 degrees,
18 minutes west.

735
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:48,447
- We are in severe distress.
- What should I do?

736
01:07:49,049 --> 01:07:51,950
Don't go on deck.
The engines, check on Dagmar.

737
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:54,651
Mayday!

738
01:07:55,722 --> 01:07:58,054
Dagmar, is everything okay?

739
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:01,252
It looks good, but I'm going to stay with it.

740
01:08:01,895 --> 01:08:03,453
Take care of Patricia.

741
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:11,497
150 degrees, 18 minutes west.
Severe distress!

742
01:08:11,805 --> 01:08:13,864
No way is anyone getting this.

743
01:08:14,140 --> 01:08:15,937
- How's Dagmar?
- She's okay.

744
01:08:16,643 --> 01:08:18,770
The main boom doesn't look secure!

745
01:08:19,079 --> 01:08:21,479
It looks like it's going to bust loose!

746
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,216
What are you doing!

747
01:08:26,653 --> 01:08:28,086
It's my boat!

748
01:09:11,031 --> 01:09:14,091
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

749
01:09:55,909 --> 01:09:57,240
Patricia!

750
01:09:59,512 --> 01:10:00,911
Patricia!

751
01:11:43,783 --> 01:11:44,943
Patricia?

752
01:15:41,521 --> 01:15:42,852
Giddy up.

753
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:26,949
Dear God...

754
01:18:28,387 --> 01:18:30,548
...whose name I do not know...

755
01:18:32,558 --> 01:18:34,549
...thank you for my life.

756
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:38,961
I forgot...

757
01:18:40,066 --> 01:18:41,556
<i>...how big...</i>

758
01:18:47,773 --> 01:18:49,138
Thank you.

759
01:18:51,244 --> 01:18:52,905
Thank you for my life.

760
01:19:14,433 --> 01:19:16,924
Didn't you drink any water yourself?.

761
01:19:20,006 --> 01:19:21,268
That's for you.

762
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:23,137
What happened to the yacht?

763
01:19:24,010 --> 01:19:25,204
Lightning.

764
01:19:25,278 --> 01:19:27,542
Dagmar and the boys?

765
01:19:27,947 --> 01:19:29,505
Everything went down.

766
01:19:32,618 --> 01:19:34,745
I still have my trunks.

767
01:19:57,810 --> 01:19:59,277
What's that?

768
01:19:59,378 --> 01:20:00,970
We've been spotted.

769
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:02,537
The Waponis?

770
01:20:03,616 --> 01:20:05,584
<i>Kimosabesl</i>

771
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:34,478
Are you Joe?

772
01:20:38,084 --> 01:20:42,384
- Are you Joe Banks?
- Yeah.

773
01:21:41,914 --> 01:21:44,246
What is that? A teddy bear?

774
01:21:45,484 --> 01:21:48,715
No. It is my soul.

775
01:21:50,022 --> 01:21:51,580
I hope you don't lose it.

776
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:53,021
So do I.

777
01:21:53,926 --> 01:21:56,360
I am Tobi. Chief.

778
01:21:57,063 --> 01:21:58,587
I'm Joe Banks.

779
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:01,299
This is Patricia Graynamore.

780
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:05,092
- You speak English.
- I have learned.

781
01:22:05,337 --> 01:22:07,999
You came to stop the anger of the Woo?

782
01:22:10,976 --> 01:22:12,102
Yeah.

783
01:22:12,178 --> 01:22:14,544
Tonight we will have a big feast.

784
01:22:14,780 --> 01:22:19,376
Then you will climb to the top
of the Big Woo and jump in, okay?

785
01:22:21,187 --> 01:22:22,381
Okay.

786
01:23:13,239 --> 01:23:14,604
Stop that!

787
01:23:38,164 --> 01:23:40,655
All right, that's it! That's it!

788
01:23:41,433 --> 01:23:42,866
We're done!

789
01:23:43,969 --> 01:23:45,698
Thank you. I feel great.

790
01:24:47,399 --> 01:24:49,424
Do you know where Joe is?

791
01:24:49,902 --> 01:24:51,335
Maybe he ran away.

792
01:24:51,403 --> 01:24:53,598
Maybe he don't want to jump.

793
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:28,305
Like my tux?

794
01:25:28,374 --> 01:25:30,069
You're really going to do it?

795
01:25:30,142 --> 01:25:32,167
I might as well go out in style.

796
01:25:47,993 --> 01:25:50,655
We are the children of children...

797
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:54,597
...and we live as we are shown.
Now, a change has come.

798
01:25:54,967 --> 01:25:59,836
The Waponis like this soda
and no one will jump into the Big Woo.

799
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:03,132
They traded with this man,
your father, for a hero.

800
01:26:03,409 --> 01:26:05,240
We have no hero of our own.

801
01:26:05,477 --> 01:26:08,378
I am the Tobi. I cannot be the hero.

802
01:26:08,447 --> 01:26:10,711
It is my place to hope for my people.

803
01:26:10,783 --> 01:26:11,841
The Woo calls.

804
01:26:11,917 --> 01:26:16,149
None of my people say,
"I'll go to my end for all of you. "

805
01:26:16,855 --> 01:26:19,688
I don't have any people of my own, Chief.

806
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:22,526
I'm my only hope for a hero.

807
01:26:22,861 --> 01:26:26,194
Once more,
I will call upon the Waponis for a hero.

808
01:26:47,386 --> 01:26:49,650
The Woo wants his flesh.

809
01:26:52,524 --> 01:26:55,254
Take me to...

810
01:26:55,728 --> 01:26:57,389
...the volcano!

811
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:04,792
Is there a ceremony or anything?

812
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:06,490
No, you just jump in.

813
01:28:09,535 --> 01:28:12,163
Wait! Stop! Wait.

814
01:28:13,105 --> 01:28:14,970
Stop right there!

815
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,307
I love you.

816
01:28:17,476 --> 01:28:19,467
I've fallen in love with you.

817
01:28:19,878 --> 01:28:22,176
I've never loved anybody.
How did this happen?

818
01:28:22,247 --> 01:28:24,442
I've never even slept with him.

819
01:28:25,117 --> 01:28:27,483
And now you're going to kill yourself.

820
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:29,947
Can you give us a minute?

821
01:28:33,992 --> 01:28:36,460
- You love me?
- Yes, I love you.

822
01:28:36,662 --> 01:28:38,755
I feel like I'm going crazy.

823
01:28:38,831 --> 01:28:42,494
You can't leave me on this stinking earth
without you.

824
01:28:42,568 --> 01:28:43,796
I must do it.

825
01:28:44,169 --> 01:28:48,538
Why? The Chief doesn't even want you to.
Do you, Chief?.

826
01:28:48,607 --> 01:28:51,770
I have wasted my entire life
and now I'm going to die.

827
01:28:51,877 --> 01:28:56,211
I have a chance to die like a man.
I have to take it!

828
01:28:56,515 --> 01:28:57,846
I love you.

829
01:28:57,950 --> 01:29:01,408
I love you, too!
I've never loved anyone before, either.

830
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,513
It's great. I am glad.
But the timing stinks.

831
01:29:05,858 --> 01:29:07,189
I got to go.

832
01:29:13,031 --> 01:29:15,124
Get out of here.

833
01:29:15,200 --> 01:29:17,134
Let me do what I have to do.

834
01:29:17,269 --> 01:29:18,964
Marry me.

835
01:29:19,638 --> 01:29:21,230
What?

836
01:29:21,874 --> 01:29:24,536
Chief, could you come up here, please?

837
01:29:25,043 --> 01:29:27,307
- What are you doing?
- I want him to marry us.

838
01:29:27,379 --> 01:29:30,906
- I'm going to jump.
- So, marry me, then jump.

839
01:29:31,483 --> 01:29:34,111
- What?
- Marry us.

840
01:29:34,186 --> 01:29:35,153
Okay.

841
01:29:36,121 --> 01:29:37,952
I don't want to get married.

842
01:29:38,390 --> 01:29:40,358
Afraid of the commitment?

843
01:29:40,459 --> 01:29:44,293
You have to love and honor me
for 30 seconds. You can't handle that?

844
01:29:45,797 --> 01:29:47,458
All right. Marry us.

845
01:29:47,599 --> 01:29:49,794
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

846
01:29:50,068 --> 01:29:51,660
You want to marry her?

847
01:29:52,137 --> 01:29:53,104
Yes.

848
01:29:53,472 --> 01:29:55,633
- You want to marry him?
- Yes.

849
01:29:56,975 --> 01:29:58,272
You're married.

850
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:03,570
Thank you, Chief.

851
01:30:04,316 --> 01:30:06,079
I'm going now.

852
01:30:06,985 --> 01:30:08,316
Don't jump.

853
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:13,753
Listen to me. These are my last words.

854
01:30:14,092 --> 01:30:16,424
I have to be brave. I have to jump.

855
01:30:16,528 --> 01:30:17,859
Good-bye.

856
01:30:30,676 --> 01:30:34,373
- Don't come out here.
- I have some last words, too.

857
01:30:35,847 --> 01:30:37,644
I can't think of anything to say.

858
01:30:37,716 --> 01:30:39,684
- I'm jumping with you.
- No, you're not.

859
01:30:39,751 --> 01:30:42,276
- "Whither thou goest, I go. "
- You didn't agree to this.

860
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,219
- I do what I want.
- Don't do it for me.

861
01:30:44,289 --> 01:30:46,120
I'm not.

862
01:30:51,797 --> 01:30:54,459
Joe, nobody knows anything.

863
01:30:54,733 --> 01:30:58,669
We'll take this leap and we'll see.

864
01:30:58,971 --> 01:31:00,302
That's life.

865
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:06,970
I saw the moon when we were out on
the ocean, shining down on everything.

866
01:31:07,646 --> 01:31:11,207
I've been miserable so long.
Years of my life, wasted.

867
01:31:13,151 --> 01:31:15,813
Been a long time coming here to meet you.

868
01:31:16,655 --> 01:31:19,488
A long time, on a crooked road.

869
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:24,153
Did I ever tell you...

870
01:31:24,763 --> 01:31:26,697
...the first time I saw you...

871
01:31:27,633 --> 01:31:29,794
...I felt like I'd seen you before?

872
01:31:30,836 --> 01:31:33,270
You're not jumping without me.

873
01:31:42,180 --> 01:31:44,273
So, what are we hoping for here?

874
01:31:44,416 --> 01:31:45,747
A miracle.

875
01:31:47,152 --> 01:31:48,619
A miracle.

876
01:31:50,389 --> 01:31:51,754
I love you.

877
01:31:51,823 --> 01:31:53,222
You do?

878
01:31:53,825 --> 01:31:55,383
This is it.

879
01:31:58,063 --> 01:31:59,325
This is it.

880
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,899
Give me your hand.

881
01:32:18,750 --> 01:32:20,217
I love you, too.

882
01:32:51,049 --> 01:32:52,380
Patricia?

883
01:33:04,796 --> 01:33:06,354
Why aren't you dead?

884
01:33:07,466 --> 01:33:08,763
Why aren't you dead?

885
01:33:08,834 --> 01:33:10,233
I don't know.

886
01:33:11,069 --> 01:33:14,903
- The volcano.
- We jumped in and it blew us out.

887
01:33:15,107 --> 01:33:16,574
That's impossible.

888
01:33:16,808 --> 01:33:19,140
I'd say, at least it's a miracle.

889
01:33:21,980 --> 01:33:23,914
There goes Waponi Woo.

890
01:33:25,751 --> 01:33:28,413
God. We really lucked out.

891
01:33:31,923 --> 01:33:33,447
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

892
01:33:33,592 --> 01:33:34,752
But what?

893
01:33:34,826 --> 01:33:38,421
I hate to mention it,
but we're in the middle of nowhere.

894
01:33:39,264 --> 01:33:41,027
We're going to drown.

895
01:33:41,099 --> 01:33:44,262
No, we're not. We're going to be all right.

896
01:33:47,005 --> 01:33:50,168
I don't know how,
but we're going to be all right.

897
01:34:04,856 --> 01:34:06,255
See?

898
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:08,786
How did you do that?

899
01:34:24,142 --> 01:34:27,737
Isn't this romantic?
Who gets a honeymoon like this?

900
01:34:32,384 --> 01:34:34,545
<i>Yeah, but...</i>

901
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,748
What's the matter?

902
01:34:36,822 --> 01:34:39,154
- I still have a problem.
- What?

903
01:34:41,026 --> 01:34:43,358
I have a brain cloud.

904
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:46,992
A brain cloud.

905
01:34:48,500 --> 01:34:49,831
What is that?

906
01:34:50,669 --> 01:34:52,000
<i>Well, it's...</i>

907
01:34:52,604 --> 01:34:55,164
Maybe I should get a second opinion.

908
01:34:57,042 --> 01:35:00,534
You didn't get a second opinion
about something called a brain cloud?

909
01:35:00,846 --> 01:35:02,780
I just felt-

910
01:35:02,848 --> 01:35:05,009
What are you, a hypochondriac?

911
01:35:05,383 --> 01:35:07,544
I was. Not now.

912
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:09,587
Nothing is wrong with you.

913
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:11,782
Dr. Ellison said-

914
01:35:11,857 --> 01:35:14,189
<i>So some quack told you...</i>

915
01:35:15,026 --> 01:35:17,051
- Dr. Ellison?
- Yeah.

916
01:35:17,529 --> 01:35:19,258
That's my father's doctor.

917
01:35:19,364 --> 01:35:20,388
He is?

918
01:35:20,498 --> 01:35:24,628
Dr. Ellison doesn't have any other patients.
My father owns Dr. Ellison.

919
01:35:25,337 --> 01:35:26,804
Why would he...?

920
01:35:27,138 --> 01:35:28,469
He set you up.

921
01:35:28,607 --> 01:35:30,097
- Who?
- My father.

922
01:35:30,175 --> 01:35:32,006
You mean, he set me up?

923
01:35:32,077 --> 01:35:34,443
- Yeah.
- No.

924
01:35:35,547 --> 01:35:37,174
I don't have a brain cloud?

925
01:35:37,249 --> 01:35:41,583
Couldn't they think of something better
than "a brain cloud"?

926
01:35:42,888 --> 01:35:45,220
My whole life I've been a victim.

927
01:35:45,390 --> 01:35:48,052
I've been a dupe, a pawn.

928
01:35:49,094 --> 01:35:51,289
My throat is closing up.

929
01:35:51,363 --> 01:35:55,663
No, Joe. Your whole life is ahead of you.

930
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:58,401
That's true.

931
01:35:58,470 --> 01:36:00,438
That's good news.

932
01:36:01,907 --> 01:36:03,340
I suppose so.

933
01:36:03,408 --> 01:36:06,377
- It's great!
- Yeah, that's good.

934
01:36:07,579 --> 01:36:10,548
I'm relieved. That's great. I'm saved!

935
01:36:14,419 --> 01:36:15,681
<i>But...</i>

936
01:36:17,989 --> 01:36:20,150
What is it now?

937
01:36:22,594 --> 01:36:26,428
We're on a raft, no land in sight.
I don't know.

938
01:36:28,934 --> 01:36:32,097
It'll always be something with you,
won't it?

939
01:36:33,705 --> 01:36:35,002
Yeah.

940
01:36:36,942 --> 01:36:38,773
I'll tell you one thing:

941
01:36:39,377 --> 01:36:42,039
Wherever we go, whatever we do...

942
01:36:43,048 --> 01:36:45,380
...we're taking this luggage with us.

943
01:36:46,351 --> 01:36:47,579
Deal.

944
01:36:58,730 --> 01:37:00,595
I wonder where we'll end up?

945
01:37:01,299 --> 01:37:03,790
Away from the things of man, my love.

946
01:37:05,003 --> 01:37:07,164
Away from the things of man.
