## Laravel version
The following link can be used to keep the application in sync with Laravel's master branch: [compare to laravel master](https://github.com/laravel/laravel/compare/0f58190c7ba955cf7a58b47a9469bf4c6c992abb...master)

## General information
* Language codes use [ISO 639-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) (same as Tesseract)

## Queues
Subtitle Tools runs four separate queue workers. The supervisor config that keeps these workers running is listed below. The queue workers that handle sub/idx and sup OCR jobs are [nice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_(Unix)). OCR'ing is a CPU heavy job, it will consume all available processing power of the thread it is running on. Making them nice ensures that web requests and other more important work is given priority.

    [program:st-worker-default]
    process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
    command=php /var/www/st/current/artisan queue:work --queue=default,A500 --sleep=2 --tries=1
    numprocs=3
    autorestart=true

    [program:st-worker-broadcast]
    process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
    command=php /var/www/st/current/artisan queue:work --queue=broadcast --sleep=2 --tries=2

    command=nice php /var/www/st/current/artisan queue:work --queue=A100,A150,A200,A300,A400,A500 --sleep=2 --tries=1
    autorestart=true
    user=www-data

    [program:st-worker-2]
    process_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d
    command=nice php /var/www/st/current/artisan queue:work --queue=A150,B200,A100,A200,A300,A400,A500 --sleep=2 --tries=1

### Processing all jobs
While debugging, you can run the following command to process all jobs:
```bash
artisan queue:work --queue=broadcast,default,B200,A150,A100,A200,A300,A400,A500 --sleep=2 --tries=1
```

### Jobs per queue
The list below shows which queue runs which jobs. The order in which the queues are handled can be found in the supervisor config above.

<details>
    <summary>Jobs per queue</summary>

- **default**
    - All `FileJobs`
    - `StartSubIdxBatchJob`
    - `UpdateSubIdxBatchStatusJob`
- **broadcast**
    - All events
- **A100**
    - `BuildSupSrtJob`
- **A150**
    - `ExtractSubIdxLanguageJob` (for batches)
- **A200**
    - `ExtractSupImagesJob`
- **A300**
    - `OcrImageJob`
- **A400**
    - `OcrImageJob` (when the job in queue A300 takes too long, it is re-dispatched on this lower priority queue with a higher timeout)
- **A500**
    - `RecordUploadedFileMimesJob` and other low priority diagnostic jobs
    - `CollectSupMetaJob`
    - `CollectStoredFileMetaJob`
    - `SubIdxbatch\RemoveSourceFiles`
- **B200**
    - `ExtractSubIdxLanguageJob`
</details>

## Adding a FileGroup + FileJob tool
* Make a new controller that extends `FileJobController`, add routes and views
* Make a new job that extends `FileJob`

## Adding a new plain-text format
* Create a `NewFormat` class that extends the abstract `TextFile`
* Make it use either the `WithFileContent` trait or the `WithFileLines` trait
* If it can be converted to `Srt`, implement the `TransformsToGenericSubtitle` interface
* Add the `NewFormat` class to the `$formats` array in `\App\Subtitles\TextFileFormat`

# Test users
A seeded database has the following users. The password of every user is "password".

| Email | Role | Scenario | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| admin@example.com | Admin | |
| user@example.com | User | Has sub/idx batches, has batch tokens |
| user-new@example.com | User | Newly registered and verified user, has no batch tokens |
